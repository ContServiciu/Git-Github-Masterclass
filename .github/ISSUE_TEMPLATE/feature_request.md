**This is a mock-up file, one of the many files created during the course. All information provided in it is inaccurate can be safely ignored!**

**Is your suggestion related to a specific Git concept?**
A clear description of what is missing. (e.g., "I'm always frustrated when I forget the difference between git reset and git revert, and there's no note about it here.")

**Describe the "Learning Feature" you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what content should be added. (e.g., "I want a new .txt file or a markdown table in Section 7 that compares reset and revert with clear examples.")

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Any other way this could be explained. (e.g., "Maybe we could just add a link to an external guide, but a local cheat sheet would be more accessible.")

**How will this help other students?**
Add any other context about why this addition is important for someone mastering Git. Feel free to attach a screenshot of a terminal output you think would make a great example!
