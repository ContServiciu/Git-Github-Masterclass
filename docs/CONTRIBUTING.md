## How can I contribute?

### Using other endpoints
Since this repo is the result of a Git & GitHub masterclass, I encourage exploring access through different methods. If you managed to clone the repo using SSH instead of HTTPS, or if you've been experimenting with the GitHub CLI (gh), feel free to add a note in the resources folder. Any "pro-tips" for the terminal are highly valued!

### New features
Our "features" are actually the lessons learned. You can contribute by:

   - Clarifying notes: Found a better way to explain git rebase vs git merge? Update the corresponding .txt file.

   - Code snippets: Have a tiny JS script that demonstrates a concept better? Drop it into a new subfolder.

   - Style updates: Is our index.html looking a bit "1995"? A bit of CSS to make it look like a real portfolio is always welcome.
     
### Report bugs
Yes, even notes can have bugs! Maybe I mistyped a Git command or confused origin with upstream in one of the markdown files.
     
#### How do I submit a good bug report?
If you spot a mistake, open an Issue and follow these steps:

   - Clear Title: e.g., "Syntax error in checkout command".

   - Description: Point out where the error is and why it's incorrect.

   - Proposed Fix: Write the command you believe is correct. Bonus points if you include a screenshot of your terminal proving your version works!
