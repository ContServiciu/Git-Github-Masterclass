45. Adding a README file

```displays a block of code```
[here]() inserts hyperlink

Conventions:
# Add a header - title
## ... ###### subheaders

## Instalation guide - main steps and particularities

## Info on how to use the code and any requirements (keys, urls etc.)

## Info on how people can contribute - redirect to a contributing.md

## On github, set topics!

********************************************************************
46. Adding the important templates

Subject covered on Github; check the docs and .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folders in the repository

********************************************************************
47. Filtering the Git Log to Better Understand the repo

Additional repository exploring as a collaborator:
git log: displays info about commits/branches

git log --graph: same as above, but with visual queues for forking/mergin branches

git shortlog: get info regarding contributors and their activity

git log --author="*author's name*": retrieve commits added by the author in question

git log --grep=*text*: helps you find a commit based on the commit's comment

git log --since=*start of time interval*: alows you to look up based on when it was commited

>>> --author, --grep and --since can be used at the same time

48. The Full Contribution Flow - Beyond Pull Requests

This segment covers cloning, branching, pulling and pushing repos. As this has already been coverd and userd throughout the course, no special project/feature/snippet was created.

Since templates were created, the only difference is filling in the template upon creating a pull request.

49. Importance and Naming of Feature Branches

To maintain a working version of the project while continuing to implement features you need to use branches. (feature branches, avoid pushing to master at all costs)

For feature branches, the name should be relevant and have an identifier tying it to the issue.

Feature request: "feature request #1" (issue created on github)
Branch name: "feature-1"

Bug report: "bug report #345"
Branch name: "bug-345"

Very urgent bug request: "very urgent bug #1091"
Branch name: "hotfix-1091"

Bottomline, use the convention set up by the team/repo owner.

If a branch doesn't cover the entire task, you can use this:
"feature-1/change-color"
"feature-1/add-margin"

50. Importance of Descriptive Commits

Messages ettiquette:
- limit message to 50 characters(to avoid message being cut); if you use a commit body leave the first line empty;
- capitalize message;
- don't end the message with a period ".";
- use the body to add a message, not the header! aim for less than 72 characters per line;
- In the body explain what/why has changed;
